2. Each film 🎭 has different specifications; including: name, name of 3 prominent actors, IMDB score (between 0 and 10), name of producer and director 🎬 (both are human!) and year of production and ...
3. The club manager has the ability to add videos 📹 and customers 👥.
4. The customer 👤 can enter his details 📝.
5. The program has the ability to search 🔍 in movies and customers.
6. The manager of the club can lend a movie 🤝 to the customer.
7. The program is able to print the report 📊 of the borrowers 📄 along with the loaned film.
8. All the above tasks are done in the console environment 💻.
9. The program does not 🚫 save the information in the file 💾 and the information is deleted after its execution 🔥.
